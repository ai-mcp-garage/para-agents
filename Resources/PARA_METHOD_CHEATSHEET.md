# PARA One‑Page Cheatsheet

> **Purpose:** A fast, no‑thinking guide to classify any markdown file and keep Areas clean over time.

---

## 1️⃣ PARA in One Sentence Each

- **Projects** → Active commitments with a clear finish line
- **Areas** → Ongoing responsibilities that must not degrade
- **Resources** → Reusable knowledge and future leverage
- **Archives** → Closed loops and historical context

---

## 2️⃣ Universal File Classification Flow (Use Every Time)

Ask these **in order**. Stop as soon as one is true.

### Q1 — Is this serving a **specific, active outcome** right now?
- Started
- Committed
- Requires action

➡️ **YES → Project**

---

### Q2 — If not active: is this **reusable knowledge** future‑me would want?
Examples:
- how‑tos
- lessons learned
- patterns
- reference notes
- ideas not yet committed

➡️ **YES → Resource**

---

### Q3 — Is this **done, historical, or unlikely to be reused directly**?
Examples:
- finished project notes
- old plans
- decisions already made
- outdated context

➡️ **YES → Archive**

---

## 3️⃣ Folder vs Subfolder Rule

After category selection:

> **Does this file fit an existing mental bucket I instantly recognize?**

- YES → put it there
- NO → create a folder **only if**:
  - more files of this type are expected
  - the name is clear and < 5 words

🚫 Never create a folder for a single file unless you're confident it will grow.

---

## 4️⃣ Promotion & Demotion Rules (State Changes)

- **Resource → Project** when you commit
- **Project → Archive** when finished or abandoned
- **Resource → Archive** only when clearly obsolete

⚠️ Never duplicate files across PARA. **Move = state change.**

---

## 5️⃣ Special Case: "Pending Projects"

If it's:
- not started
- not scheduled
- not committed

➡️ It is **NOT a Project**

Store as:
- **Resource → Possible Projects / Someday / Incubating**

The moment you say *yes*, promote it to **Project**.

---

## 6️⃣ Areas: How to Create Them (Use Sparingly)

**Definition:**
> A responsibility that would cause problems if ignored for 3 months.

### Create a new Area only if ALL are true:
1. Ongoing responsibility
2. Expected to last 12+ months
3. Produces multiple projects over time

Valid examples:
- Home
- Personal
- Career / Work
- Parenting
- Fitness (if structured)

Invalid examples:
- Learning X
- Side Project Y
- Home Lab

---

## 7️⃣ Area Design Rules

- Areas should be **stable for years**
- Change only when life structure changes
- Avoid emotional or identity‑based Areas

Inside an Area:
- reference notes
- checklists
- standards

🚫 Projects should almost never live inside Areas.

---

## 8️⃣ Quarterly Area Health Check

For each Area, ask:
- Is this still a real responsibility?
- Am I okay with this never being "done"?
- Has it generated projects recently?

If all answers are NO → Archive the Area.

---

## 9️⃣ Mental Model (Remember This)

- **Projects = promises**
- **Areas = obligations**
- **Resources = leverage**
- **Archives = closure**

If classification feels hard, you're deciding too early. Drop it into Resources and move on.
