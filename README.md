# para-agents
Agents and commands to organize knowledge via the PARA method.

How to Use

cursor: as-is
antigravity: put the slash commands in .agent/workflows (why google)
claude: .claude/commands
vscode: .github/prompts (wtf microsoft)

Note: If I add skills in the future, skills end up in the same dotfolder but with the skills subdirectory.
